# Keeper MERN stack

### `Project description`

This project is an extension of the last project from the React.js module from "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. I wanted to expand the local project with the MongoDB database, but I had a lot of difficulties. I came across "How to Use MERN Stack: A Complete Guide" by MongoDB. There is a very well presented example of the use of the MERN stack, which I studied and used for my own use.

This video shows how this site works.

### `MongoDB`
Remember, I'm using MongoDB here, so you need to create your project and a cluster to which you will get a link containing your private <name> and <password>. You must save this link in an .env file in the server folder under the ATLAS_URI variable. If you want a different one, no problem, you just have to change the in conn.mjs variable to your own in the server/db/conn.mjs file
